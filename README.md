## About The Project
<br />

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://sounder-app.kerokuapp.com)

**Sounder-app** is a full-stack web application that uses the Spotify-Web-API to provide song recomendations based on the user's liked songs library. 

With an intuitive flow and a tinder-like interface, the user can hear new track recomendations and personalize it by liking or disliking it. Additionally, the user is able to add all their liked songs to a new playlist and listen in their Spotify account.
